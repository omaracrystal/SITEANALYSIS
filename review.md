##OVERALL SUGGESTIONS/ IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

###ALL
    1. white background instead of link pink(or maybe I'm seeing it wrong?) (clashes with red a little bit)
    1. Gray text is nice but once the background is white, it might be best to have the text be black for good contrast. 

###HEADER
    1. Hamburger Menu… on click, options justified to the center or right
    1. Place social icons here and put number and email in footer instead (or have sticker header and sticker footer)
    1. 

###MAIN
####Home
    1. Picture slider behind slogan: ‘Technical Strategy, Architecture, and Expertise for Open Solutions’
    1. Under "Our Services" section add a SVG or Font Awesome Icon for the each subheader: Performance, Development Leads, & Technical Strategy 
    1. Contact appear as modal than appear on seperate page

####Leadership
    1. Photos of Leaders with links to social media as optional
    1. test

####We're Hiring
    1. Redesign form and supply ability to upload a resume and provide a field for providing a portfolio. Have option to add Github, LinkedIn, etc.
    1. Enlarge Submit button - similar to the "contact button" on main page

####What we Do
    1. Center all info
    1. Add a SVG or Font Awesome Icon for each subheader
    1. Just like the Linkedin page, would be nice to have a cluster/ collage of all the tools you work with

####Blog
    1. Have Side-menu fixed when scrolling through blogs.
    1. Maybe add search input - so key words can searched such as Angular, NodeJS, WordPress, etc. 
    1. Have sharing abilities in the same fixed area where the side-menu is
    1. Under 1000px the side-menu goes to bottom of page (put on top of page fixed position) 

###FOOTER
    1. See Header #2
    1. Under 400px the social icons and "Copyright © 2016 - Ndevr, Inc." should either appear on seperate lines or the same line
    1. Copyright 2016 - should be 2015?

###EXTRA
    1. Make Single Page Application? (For faster loading times?)
    1. Add Case Studies to Menu
